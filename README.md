# MemoPool

[Demo Video](https://youtu.be/2OPVYo9Li78)

MemoPool is a browser-based, anonymity-focused memo app that combines personal note-taking with optional social sharing. It uses GPT-4 to analyze sentiments/moods in your memos, allowing users to learn more about themselves. Ease of use + optionality for the user to be private/public is key — absolutely ZERO info about identity is collected.

**tldr, think Apple Notes but with the optionality to post notes privately or publicly, with GPT-4 capabilities to analyze each individual notes to better provide insights.**

## Key Features

### Anonymity and Privacy
We do not require any personal information to use any aspects of MemoPool.

### GPT-4 powered memo analysis
We use GPT-4 under the hood to analyze memos, which could allow the user to spark new insights, synthesize past thoughts, and learn more about themselves in a way that a traditional note-taking app cannot.

### Optionality to post in public MemoPool social network
If the user wants to publicize memos to the public MemoPool, they can create their own User ID — tying it with their key ID. Creation of a User ID is completely optional, and does not restrict a user from viewing memos in the public MemoPool.

### Key ID system
A unique key ID lets you access your memos across sessions or devices. When generating a key ID, please remember to store your key ID somewhere you can remember it. All of your memos are tied to this!

### Intuitive ease of use
MemoPool was designed with simplicity in mind — Apple Notes was a large inspiration in terms of ease of use and just to ability to quickly jot down a thought without much overhead.
