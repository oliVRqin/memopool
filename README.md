MemoPool is a browser-based, anonymity-focused memo app that combines personal note-taking with optional social sharing. It uses GPT-4 to analyze sentiments/moods in your memos, allowing users to learn more about themselves. Ease of use + optionality for the user to be private/public is key â€” absolutely ZERO info about identity is collected.

tldr, think Apple Notes but with the optionality to post notes privately or publicly, with GPT-4 capabilities to analyze each individual notes to better provide insights.
